#Jithin Aji Portfolio

This is a simple portfolio web page containing some of my projects. The tools used here are Sass and Webpack. Both of these tools are relatively new for me. Webpack I have used to bundle my javascript file together. The javascript code which I coded here is some of the cleanest Javascript codes I have ever written. Although I have coded more challenging applications, I have put more effort here to code in a clean and readable manner with appropriate use of comments. Even spenting time on readme is not my usual style. But recently I understood the importance of documentation. Probably the most unclean code will be my Sass stylesheet. Sass was kind enough to me so that I could jump write in to coding without properly reading about Sass. This approach can be clearly read from the way I have written the stylesheet.

##Directory info

The main.css and main.js file from dist folder is used in the webpage. The src folder contains two javascript and sass files which are built to generate main.js and main.css files.

```npm run start````
This command will run webpack and watch for changes in source file and automatically build main.js and main.css files.

##Future Updates

I will likely build the blog part also in to the same repository and probably beg for a coffee money to all the willing users.
